 * Class representing a single type of message filter.

 * the [checkCreate] function. This function should check whether a message is problematic, action it
 * appropriately, and return `false` if processing should stop here, or `true` if other filters
 * should be checked.
 *
 * If your filter doesn't delete or otherwise action the message (that is to say, it's only for alerting),
 * then it may be best to return `true` so the rest of the filters can be executed. Whether this is
 * truly the case will depend on what exactly your filter is doing, though.
